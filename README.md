# SmartAgri AI: Intelligent Crop Disease Detection

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

SmartAgri AI is an intelligent solution designed to detect crop diseases early using image recognition and machine learning, empowering farmers with timely insights to take preventive action and increase yield.

## Background

Crop disease is a major cause of agricultural loss globally. Many farmers, especially in rural or underserved areas, lack access to agricultural experts who can diagnose plant diseases. Early detection is critical, but current methods are either manual or inaccessible to smallholder farmers.

This project aims to:
* Reduce crop losses by detecting diseases early
* Empower smallholder farmers with AI-assisted decision making
* Improve food security in regions dependent on agriculture

My personal motivation comes from growing up in a farming community and seeing first-hand the losses due to undiagnosed plant issues. Making AI accessible to farmers can significantly improve livelihoods.

## How is it used?

Farmers can take a photo of the affected plant using a mobile app or upload it to a web portal. The AI model analyzes the image, detects the presence and type of disease, and provides:
* Diagnosis of the issue
* Confidence score
* Suggested actions or treatments

**Users:** Farmers, agricultural extension officers, NGOs, and agri-tech companies.

**Environment:** Rural/remote areas with limited access to agronomists but with smartphones or internet cafés.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:
* PlantVillage dataset (public dataset of labeled crop disease images)
* Local agricultural extension data (if available)
* Crowdsourced farmer image submissions

AI methods:
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification
* TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch frameworks
* Mobile optimization using TensorFlow Lite

| Component            | Description                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Dataset              | PlantVillage, custom annotated images  |
| AI Framework         | TensorFlow, Keras                      |
| Model Architecture   | CNN with image preprocessing           |
| Output               | Disease label + confidence score       |

## Challenges

* Limited internet access may hinder image upload from remote areas
* Model accuracy may vary with image quality or unusual crop conditions
* Not a replacement for expert diagnosis in rare or complex cases
* Ethical concern: misuse of data, ensuring farmer data privacy

## What next?

* Improve model accuracy by including more localized disease images
* Add multilingual support for app instructions and diagnosis
* Partner with agriculture NGOs for deployment and farmer training
* Develop an offline model version for areas with no internet
